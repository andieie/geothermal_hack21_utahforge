## Utah_Forge Data

The idea is to get all of the available data of the Utah Forge site onto Python
in a nice intuitive way. The end product would have a way of visualizing the
data and pull it automatically to get it into other subsurface tools.

A cool way could be : 

utahforge.mt(fetch) 
" Fetches all of the mt data available " 

utahforge.all 
" Shows you a database of all the available data"
